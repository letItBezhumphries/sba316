# Minesweeper - single page application

## Built mostly with javascript, DOM Elements, CSS and html

> So far this is a work in progress, Its really just a simple minesweeper application where I'm am trying to use solely DOM properties, javascript and event listeners to create the effect of having an appication render page elements dynamically. So, for the sign in form, I used event listeners and javascript objects to store a users data, hit the refresh button completely wipes any progress or saved games state. This project is just an exercise in getting more familiar with Event Listeners, the DOM and ways to manipulate a page with JS and no frameworks.
> I feel like I was successful at implementing the amount that I could given the time constraints, I left off with a big event bubbling issue where clicking a square on the gameboard causes the game timer to reset. I have a feeling its probably due to setInterval and something I'am overlooking.
